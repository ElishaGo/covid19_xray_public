# covid19_xray

Welcome everyone! This is our shared repo for all code, datasource compilations and pointers to interesting nets we would like to test, and everything else that is related to our effort. Please feel free to contribute! If you have any deliberations, please feel free to discuss and find a good way to share. 

We're still in building stages, so feel free to organize things in any way you feel right - folders, etc.

To keep order, please make your developments on branches and merge to master when they're mature and ready for other users to use. 

Good luck!
